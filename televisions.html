      <h1>ðŸ“º Televisions</h1>
      <p>There are different types of TV screens, and some use more energy than others. LED is the most common display technology today. These TVs use a liquid crystal display (LCD) with light-emitting diodes (LED) for backlighting. More recently, organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TVs have appeared. Unlike LED TVs, OLED screens create their own light without backlighting. This is the same technology used in many modern smartphones.</p>

      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <p>This section shows findings from the Australian Governmentâ€™s dataset on the energy consumption of televisions sold in Australia. Our website makes it simple to compare TVs, helping Australians choose the right size and energy-efficient model for their needs.</p>
