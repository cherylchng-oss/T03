# Data Story  
This project is designed for an audience of everyday consumers, particularly Australian households, who are interested in choosing energy-efficient appliances. Our visualisations focus on televisions because they are one of the most common appliances in homes and can have a big impact on electricity bills over time. By presenting clear comparisons of screen sizes, technologies, power use, and star ratings, the goal is to help users quickly understand which TVs are most efficient and what factors matter when making a purchase. The audience will benefit from these insights as they balance cost, energy savings, and environmental concerns.

# About the Data  

### Data Source  
The data set published by the Australian Government at (https://data.gov.au/) contains information about the energy consumption of televisions sold in Australia.  

### Data Processing  
The raw data was cleaned and simplified using Knime.

This processing ensured that the dataset could be visualised using D3.js charts without overwhelming complexity.  

### Privacy  
No personal or sensitive information is included in this dataset. It only contains publicly available product specifications and energy rating details.  

### Accuracy and Limitations  
While the data is based on reliable public sources, there may be some limitations:  
- Not all television models on the Australian market are included.  
- Some product specifications may have changed over time.  
- The dataset is simplified for educational purposes and may not capture every technical detail.  

### Ethics  
The data was collected from open, publicly available resources. It is used here strictly for academic and educational purposes, with full acknowledgement of the original sources.
